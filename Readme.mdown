A little toy application that computes the sinogram of a given image, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinogram.

For testing purposes, you can use the test image in the repository. Usage:

	main [input_image] [output_image.png]

The input may either be in jpg or png format, the output will always be png.
